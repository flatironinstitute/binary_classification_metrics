    "## Jupyter widgets are great for exploring data in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AUPR is great for \"google search\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## But AUPR is not really appropriate for system biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AUPR penalizes early misses too much and ignores late hits too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An early miss could be an error in the \"gold standard\", maybe the inference was right!\n",
    "\n",
    "## For many use cases you want to get many/nearly all hits early, not just a few at the front.\n",
